For this exercise, we will have to create a sign from scratch. The Assignment is the following: 
"For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

Do not be afraid to use google or go back to previous lessons to look something up. Real-life, professional developers use google constantly for things that they have been doing for years. At this point it is not expected that you will have everything memorized, so don’t worry about it. Additionally, there are a few small details that you may not have encountered in our lessons yet. This is by design. These details are minor, and easily searched (e.g. google css rounded corners).

Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect. Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. It doesn’t matter if you use margin: 24px when the design actually has margin: 48px.

Finally, feel free to substitute your own content into this design. The images have some meaningless dummy content, but if you want to make up a business and personalize this page, please feel free to do so! Insert actual images in the placeholders, and feel free to play with the colors and fonts a bit too."

After reading this and taking a look on the picture of the "finished" Product. We have the following things to do:

1. Create an Html
2. Assign Parents and Children according to the Picture and styling of the Product.
3. Style the website in Css and switch to html to organize the Containers and Flex-Items.
4. Style each Content-Block after the other, in this Case we will go from Top to Bottom.
5. As soon as the Product looks identical to the End-Product. Check the Code for Errors or unnecessary lines.
6. Do the fine tuning to get everything as it is meant to be.
7. Check the Code again, after cutting it down to the essential things check the Website aswell to see if your changes really didn't have any impact. While Checking the Code you can also write a few comments at places where the codeline won't explain itself and you need an explaination.
8. After controlling everything you can feel free to Push it to Git.
